(** [Unsat] is raised if a canonical constraint C â‰¡ false. *)
exception Unsat

(** [OverlappingInstances] is raised if two rules of kind (E) overlap. *)
exception OverlappingInstances of tname * variable

(** [MultipleClassDefinitions k] is raised if two rules of kind (I)
    share the same goal. *)
exception MultipleClassDefinitions of tname

(** [UnboundClass k] is raised if the type class [k] occurs in a
    constraint while it is undefined. *)
exception UnboundClass of tname

(** Student! This is your job! You must implement the following functions: *)
